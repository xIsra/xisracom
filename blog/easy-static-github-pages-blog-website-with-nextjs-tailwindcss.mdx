## Step 1: Setting Up the Project

First, I created a new Next.js project with Tailwind CSS:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-website
cd my-website
```

I selected the following options during the setup:

TypeScript: Yes
ESLint: Yes
Tailwind CSS: Yes
src/ directory: No
App Router: Yes
Import alias: No

## Step 2: Installing AOS

To add smooth animations, I installed AOS (Animate On Scroll):

```bash
npm install aos
```

## Step 3: Configuring AOS

In the `_app.js` file, I imported and initialized AOS:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import AOS from 'aos';
import 'aos/dist/aos.css';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    AOS.init({
      duration: 800,
      once: false,
    });
  }, []);

  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

## Step 4: Developing the Website

I created the necessary components and pages, utilizing Next.js's file-based routing system. I used Tailwind CSS for styling and AOS for animations.

Example component with AOS:

```jsx
<div data-aos="fade-up">
  <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Welcome to My Website</h1>
</div>
```

## Step 5: Preparing for Deployment

To deploy to GitHub Pages, I created a `next.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  output: 'export',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
};
```

I also added a `.nojekyll` file in the `public` folder to prevent GitHub Pages from processing the files with Jekyll.

## Step 6: Creating a GitHub Repository

I created a new repository on GitHub and pushed my local project to it:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 7: Configuring GitHub Actions

I created a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file for automatic deployments:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run export
      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./out
```

## Step 8: Enabling GitHub Pages

In the GitHub repository settings, I set the GitHub Pages source to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Step 9: Setting Up a Custom Domain

I purchased a domain and added it to the GitHub Pages settings.

## Step 10: Configuring Cloudflare

1. I created a Cloudflare account and added my domain.
2. I updated my domain's nameservers to Cloudflare's.
3. In Cloudflare's DNS settings, I added:
- An `A` record pointing to GitHub Pages' IP addresses.
- A `CNAME` record for the `www` subdomain.

## Step 11: Enabling HTTPS

In Cloudflare, I turned on the "Always use HTTPS" option to ensure secure connections.

## Conclusion

With these steps, I successfully created a modern, animated website using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and AOS, deployed it to GitHub Pages, and set up a custom domain with Cloudflare. This stack provides a great balance of performance, ease of development, and cost-effectiveness for personal websites and small projects.
